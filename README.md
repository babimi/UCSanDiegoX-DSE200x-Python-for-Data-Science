# UCSanDiegoX-DSE200x-Python-for-Data-Science

This is finial project of the course "Python for date science" of Data Science MicroMasters program.
This study is devoted to the role of quarantine in fighting with Coronavirus. We use a dataset from Kaggle’s database to figure out whether or not quarantine helps governments to control it. We also predict the growth rate of Coronavirus in a country with quarantine and two countries without quarantine. Our study shows that quarantine does not necessarily control the Coronavirus. Also we develop a linear regression model as well as a polynomial regression model for growth rate and death rate which both belong to “supervised” machine learning.
